###### Also you can watch the animation of the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJSGIk4Zh9s&feature=youtu.be">Sliding Tutorial for Android on YouTube</a></strong> in HD quality.

The invention is going to ease the problem of structural design but not to limit a stretch of your imagination at the same time. We took care of the suitability aspect. So, your app is not going to look alien among other Flutter elements. 

Applied parallax effects will make your product presentation look like Google apps tutorial.

All you need to do is:
<br>1. Create background designs for each screen of your tutorial (assistance with <a href="https://www.cleveroad.com/services/design/mobile-design">mobile design</a>)
