## Cleveroad introduces Sliding Tutorial Library for Flutter

Hey guys, hope you haven’t started developing a tutorial for your Flutter app yet, as we have already completed a part of your job. Don’t worry, we act from good motives only. Our aim is to help you create a sliding tutorial in a fast and simple manner. So we’ve done some work and voila!. A simple Flutter Sliding Tutorial library is at your service.

###### Also you can watch the animation of the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJSGIk4Zh9s&feature=youtu.be">Sliding Tutorial for Android on YouTube</a></strong> in HD quality.

The invention is going to ease the problem of structural design but not to limit a stretch of your imagination at the same time. We took care of the suitability aspect. So, your app is not going to look alien among other Flutter elements. 

Applied parallax effects will make your product presentation look like Google apps tutorial.

<br>1. Create background designs for each screen of your tutorial (assistance with <a href="https://www.cleveroad.com/services/design/mobile-design">mobile design</a>)
